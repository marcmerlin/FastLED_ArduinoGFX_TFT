FastLED_ArduinoGFX_TFT: FrameBuffer::GFX Support for TFT Screens Like SSD1331, ST7735, or ILI9341 with Adafruit GFX and FastLED APIs using Arduino_GFX
===================================================================================================================

Adafruit_GFX and FastLED-compatible library for TFT displays like SSD1331, ILI9341 or ST7735.

Note that this is a new version of https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED_SPITFT_GFX 
but instead of the multiple adafruit drivers, some being honestly better than others, and
the SPI implementation is not as reliable on each chip, this uses moononournation's 
https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX which supports a lot of TFTs and with optimized
SPI backends for better speeds and fixes issues of HWSPI not working at all on ESP32 for
SSD1331 in the adafruit driver: 
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1331-OLED-Driver-Library-for-Arduino/issues/27 . 

With Arduino::GFX, for SSD1331, I now get around 160fps on ESP32 at 80Mhz)  
You also get rotation support which is not supported on SSD1331 in the adafruit driver
( https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1331-OLED-Driver-Library-for-Arduino/issues/26 )

SSD1331 (96x64) vs ST7735 (128x128) vs ST7735 (160x128) vs ILI9341 (320x240):

(note that the ESP32 was sending ST7735 160x128 SPI which didn't work at all on SSD1331 and not quite on the ILI screen which requires its own protocol)

This is the same 96x64 display and demo between a P3 RGBPanel and an SSD1331:

The big thing to note is that this library has to store the entire framebuffer in memory, so
you'll need a processor with more RAM (like ESP8266, ESP32, Teensy, etc...), but then you benefit
from having the entire framebuffer in memory which is used for code that apply transformations
to the entire framebuffer like fading or rotations.

https://github.com/marcmerlin/Framebuffer_GFX/blob/master/README.md details the 3 APIs available
to you and why you'd want to use this layer on top of the SSD1331 driver.  
Similarly this driver works great with ST7735 based TFTs (128x128 or 128x160).
It does also work with ILI9341, but memory becomes an issue as the framebuffer uses 224KB of RAM 
which only fits on a teensy 3.5/3.6 for me (too big for ESP32) and leaves very little room to run other code.
Actually if you have an ESP32 with PSRAM, then it works perfectly fine.

This library requires FastLED and Adafruit_GFX libraries as well as this base class library:
- https://github.com/marcmerlin/Framebuffer_GFX
Please look at the Framebuffer_GFX page for details on how the APIs work and you can also look the example demo code:
- https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED_ArduinoGFX_TFT/tree/master/examples/MatrixGFXDemo

You can find a lot of demo code here:
https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED_NeoMatrix_SmartMatrix_LEDMatrix_GFX_Demos as well as
a big integrated demo here: https://github.com/marcmerlin/NeoMatrix-FastLED-IR

This library requires https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX

and these:
- https://github.com/marcmerlin/Framebuffer_GFX (base class)
- https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
- https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED  
- https://github.com/marcmerlin/LEDMatrix is optional if you have code that uses that API
